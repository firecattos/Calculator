# Calculator

[Live preview](https://firecattos.github.io/Calculator/)

This project, built as part of The Odin Project program, exposed to me lots of new stuff to learn.

Amongst everything, I think that the most useful things for future projects are the keyboard implementation, with differences between the various stages of a keypress and the method to prevent default functions from being fired; the logic behind "NaN" and "isNaN", although I used a different approach at the end.
No less important are the relative units and the aspect-ratio properties.

Another cool thing I learned is to implement fonts that aren't on online services like Google Fonts. In this project I used "Digital 7" font, which can be found [here](https://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font).
